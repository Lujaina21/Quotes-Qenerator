# Quote Generator

## Description

This is a simple and interactive **Quote Generator** built with JavaScript. The application randomly displays a quote from a predefined list of quotes each time the user clicks the "Generate Quote" button. It also shows the authorâ€™s name and an avatar image associated with the quote.

This project is ideal for anyone who wants to display motivational or inspirational quotes on their webpage, with a clean and dynamic interface.

## Features

- Displays a random quote each time the button is clicked.
- Shows the author's name and a relevant avatar.
- Prevents duplicate quotes from appearing consecutively.
- Simple and easy-to-understand JavaScript code.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Markup for the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS** - Styling the page and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript** - Logic to handle random quote selection and updating the page content dynamically.

## How It Works

1. **Quotes Array**: A list of quotes is predefined in the `quotes` array. Each quote object contains the text of the quote, the author's name, and a URL to the author's avatar image.

2. **Random Quote Generation**: When the user clicks the "Generate Quote" button, the application selects a random quote from the list, ensuring that the same quote doesn't appear twice consecutively.

3. **Updating the UI**: Once a random quote is selected, the quote text, author's name, and avatar are displayed on the page.
